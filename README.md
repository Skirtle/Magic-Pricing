# Magic-Pricing
Record of my collection of cards (ever updating, never settled)

# How to use
* Have Python 3 installed (and some modules I will put here later)
* Have an Access database named Magic.accdb


# Update 1.1
* Added a visualizer for price history (integrated in the UI)
* Fixed bug with Village Rites (JP) (There was a newline character in there)
* Fix cnxn in updatePrices.py to be a dynamic path instead of hardcoded
* Created a UI to select from all cards from the excel sheet
